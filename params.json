{"name":"Vicious","tagline":"Sound card for Apple-1 computer. Based on SID and CIA chips.","body":"Vicious - Sound Card for the Apple-1 Computer\r\n=============================================\r\nThis project is about creating a sound card for the quite legendary and pioneering home computer from the seventies, the Apple-1. \r\n\r\n### Project Status\r\n\r\nThe first prototype of the sound card exists with the features explained in this page. Some modifications need to be done to the circuit board and next version will follow. I hope it's going to be the final version.\r\n\r\n### Features Overview\r\n\r\n* SID Chip for sound generation. SID Chip is the sound chip used in Commodore 64.\r\n* CIA Chip for timed interrupt generation. Without timer there could be no rhythm. Timer can be used for other applications also.\r\n* Onboard ROM for firmware which currently is a SID Tune player with CFFA1 card integration. I also try to include an API for software access to some of the card's features.\r\n* The firmware on the card can be updated (=EEPROM re-burned) in-place by just moving the write-protection jumper and running the update program.\r\n\r\n### Technical Details\r\n\r\n* Uses only the 5V power line. SID chip needs also 12V (that is for original 6581 model, 9V for the later 8580 model) but it's generated on the card from the 5V line. Original Apple-1 should have 12V available, but most of the clones/replicas don't.\r\n* By changing 3 components on the board, it can host 8580 version of the SID chip instead of 6581 version, but I haven't tested that yet.\r\n* Occupies 4kB of the computer's memory address space: $B000-$BFFF. The firmware $B000-BEFF, SID: $BF00-$BF7F, CIA: $BF80-$BFFF.\r\n* CIA Chip's IRQ line is connected to processor's IRQ line.\r\n* Sid Tune player on the ROM can play many of the tunes created for Commodore 64 environment, but not all. Some tunes run in an address space that is not RAM in the Apple-1. Some tunes configure interrupt generating devices themselves and there are more interrupt sources on real C64 than a single CIA chip.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
